## API REST of a delivery

### About the project

- I first thought of this project as a delivery application developed to fix the concepts related to a REST API, from diagram analysis to the application of business and programming rules. But after gaining more knowledge, I decided to apply these to this project.

- The application consists of implementing a complete domain model of a Delivery.

## How to execute

### Locally
- Clone git repository
- Access the project package
- Build the project:
```
./mvnw clean package
```
- Execute:
```
java -jar delivery/target/delivery-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

The API can be accessed at localhost:8080.
### With Docker

- Clone git repository
- Access the project package
- Build the project:
```
./mvnw clean package
```
- Up docker-compose file:
```
docker-compose up
```
The API can be accessed at localhost:8080.

### API Endpoints
Just a few endpoints for the application to be tested.

To make the HTTP requests below, the PostMan tool was used.

#### CLIENTS
- POST /clients
```
http://localhost:8080/clients
```

```
{
    "name": "Person1",
    "email": "person1@gmail.com",
    "phone": "9999999"
}
```
- GET /clients/{clientId} or /clients

```
http://localhost:8080/clients/1
```

- DELETE /clients/{clientId}


- UPDATE /clients/{clientId}

```
http://localhost:8080/clients/1
```
```
{
    "name": "Person2",
    "email": "person2@gmail.com",
    "phone": "9999998"
}
```

#### Deliveries

        },
    "receiver":{
        "name":"Person3",
        "street":"Dom Pedro",

        "complement":"School"
        },

}
```
