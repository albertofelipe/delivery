## API REST of a delivery

### About the project

- I first thought of this project as a delivery application developed to fix the concepts related to a REST API, from diagram analysis to the application of business and programming rules. But after gaining more knowledge, I decided to apply these to this project.

- The application consists of implementing a complete domain model of a Delivery.
